Passing Parameters In URLs
--------------------------

You often want to send some sort of data in the URL's query string. If
you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value
pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. ``httpbin.org/get?key=val``.
Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary, using the
``params`` keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass
``key1=value1`` and ``key2=value2`` to ``httpbin.org/get``, you would use the
following code::

    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)

You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL::

    >>> print(r.url)
    http://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1

Note that any dictionary key whose value is ``None`` will not be added to the
URL's query string.

You can also pass a list of items as a value::

    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': ['value2', 'value3']}

    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)
    >>> print(r.url)
    http://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3
