More complicated POST requests
------------------------------

Typically, you want to send some form-encoded data â€” much like an HTML form.
To do this, simply pass a dictionary to the ``data`` argument. Your
dictionary of data will automatically be form-encoded when the request is made::

    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

    >>> r = requests.post("http://httpbin.org/post", data=payload)
    >>> print(r.text)
    {
      ...
      "form": {
        "key2": "value2",
        "key1": "value1"
      },
      ...
    }

There are many times that you want to send data that is not form-encoded. If
you pass in a ``string`` instead of a ``dict``, that data will be posted directly.

For example, the GitHub API v3 accepts JSON-Encoded POST/PATCH data::

    >>> import json

    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
    >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}

    >>> r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload))

Instead of encoding the ``dict`` yourself, you can also pass it directly using
the ``json`` parameter (added in version 2.4.2) and it will be encoded automatically::

    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
    >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}

    >>> r = requests.post(url, json=payload)
