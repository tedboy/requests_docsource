Redirection and History
-----------------------

By default Requests will perform location redirection for all verbs except
HEAD.

We can use the ``history`` property of the Response object to track redirection.

The :attr:`Response.history <requests.Response.history>` list contains the
:class:`Response <requests.Response>` objects that were created in order to
complete the request. The list is sorted from the oldest to the most recent
response.

For example, GitHub redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS::

    >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com')

    >>> r.url
    'https://github.com/'

    >>> r.status_code
    200

    >>> r.history
    [<Response [301]>]


If you're using GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE, you can disable
redirection handling with the ``allow_redirects`` parameter::

    >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com', allow_redirects=False)

    >>> r.status_code
    301

    >>> r.history
    []

If you're using HEAD, you can enable redirection as well::

    >>> r = requests.head('http://github.com', allow_redirects=True)

    >>> r.url
    'https://github.com/'

    >>> r.history
    [<Response [301]>]
