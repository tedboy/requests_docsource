The User Guide

.. important:: Content directly from official documentation page (`link <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/#the-user-guide>`__). I just created this page for my own liking since I love the readthedoc Sphinx theme.

This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, begins with some background information about Requests, then focuses on step-by-step instructions for getting the most out of Requests.
