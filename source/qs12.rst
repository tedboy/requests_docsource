Cookies
-------

If a response contains some Cookies, you can quickly access them::

    >>> url = 'http://example.com/some/cookie/setting/url'
    >>> r = requests.get(url)

    >>> r.cookies['example_cookie_name']
    'example_cookie_value'

To send your own cookies to the server, you can use the ``cookies``
parameter::

    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/cookies'
    >>> cookies = dict(cookies_are='working')

    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
    >>> r.text
    '{"cookies": {"cookies_are": "working"}}'

Cookies are returned in a :class:`~requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar`,
which acts like a ``dict`` but also offers a more complete interface,
suitable for use over multiple domains or paths.  Cookie jars can
also be passed in to requests::

    >>> jar = requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar()
    >>> jar.set('tasty_cookie', 'yum', site='httpbin.org', path='/cookies')
    >>> jar.set('gross_cookie', 'blech', site='httpbin.org', path='/elsewhere')
    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/cookies'
    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=jar)
    >>> r.text
    '{"cookies": {"tasty_cookie": "yum"}}'
