Other Authentication
--------------------

Requests is designed to allow other forms of authentication to be easily and
quickly plugged in. Members of the open-source community frequently write
authentication handlers for more complicated or less commonly-used forms of
authentication. Some of the best have been brought together under the
`Requests organization`_, including:

- Kerberos_
- NTLM_

If you want to use any of these forms of authentication, go straight to their
GitHub page and follow the instructions.
